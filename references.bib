  abstract  = {Abstract:
               This chapter examines the piezoelectric characteristics and common applications of quartz crystal. Section 5.1 covers the discovery of quartz crystal piezoelectricity including its structure and its differences from other piezoelectric materials. Section 5.2 compares natural quartz crystal with artificial quartz crystal and explains the methods and specifications for artificial quartz crystal growth. Section 5.3 introduces typically applied quartz crystal plates for vibrators and shows actual cutting angles. These vibrators include the most popular AT-cut thickness share mode and the tuning fork bending mode, and their characteristics such as frequency and temperature are explained in detail. This section also shows examples of quartz crystal miniaturization using another cutting method developed by the River Eletec Corporation. Section 5.4 demonstrates applications and standards for the quartz crystal vibrators and oscillators described throughout the chapter.},
